# First React

An experimental project to build a full-stack web app with React, Express, Socket IO, and more, without using create-react-app.

## Quick Start

1. Install the npm packages  
  `npm install`

1. Build the application  
  `npm run build`

1. Run the application  
  `npm run start`

1. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Commands

* **Build**  
  Runs webpack to build the client-side Javascript.  
  `npm run build`  

* **Build Development**  
  Runs webpack to build the client-side Javascript with sourcemaps for easier debugging.  
  `npm run buildDev` 

* **Test**  
  Runs Jest to test the code.  
  `npm run test`

* **Linting**  
  Runs ESLint to lint both the client and server-side code.  
  `npm run lint`

* **Linting Fix**  
  Runs ESLint with --fix to lint the code and attempt to automatically apply fixes.  
  `npm run lintFix`

* **Start**  
  Runs the application on port 3000.  
  `npm run start`


## Tools and Config

* **React**  
  Used for the creating the interface.

* **Express**  
  Used for the web server.

* **Socket IO**  
  Used for implementing web-sockets in the application.

* **Editor Config**  
  Sets editor settings for supported editors.  
  May require a plugin for some editors, including Atom and VS Code.  
  Configured in `.editorconfig`

* **ES Lint**  
  Used for Javascript linting.  
  Configured in `package.json` and with `.eslintignore`.

* **Webpack**  
  Used for running build tasks.  
  Configured with `webpack.config.js` and `webpack.dev.config.js` in the config folder.

* **Babel**  
  JS compiler for client-side code.  
  Configured in `package.json`.

* **Jest**  
  Used for testing.  
  Configured in `package.json`.

* **Enzyme**  
  Used for improved testing of React components.  
  Configured in `config/jest/jestSetup.js`

## Project Structure

* **Client**  
  Contains the client-side code to be compiled with Webpack and Babel.

* **Public**  
  Contains static files that will be hosted by the server, including the compiled Javascript generated by Webpack.

* **Server**  
  Contains the server-side code, including index.js, which is executed with `npm run start` to run the application.

* **Config**  
  Contains Webpack and Jest config files.

## Tests

Testing files for React components are named with `.spec.js` and are located in the same directory as the component being tested. Jest will automatically find files with this extension when running the `npm run test` command.
